Please follow these instructions to install and setup RUCE SIH computers.
1. Copy the "SIH Devices Full Offline" Setup to the Public folder on the computer. I personally use FastCopy392_installer.exe as i find it faster to copy. But its up to you.

2. Run the "Admin Make User Account Setup 0.0.bat" file as admin. This script will ask you to put the laptop name and number and will proceede to creating a new account e.g. "SIH ACER 01" or "SIH DELL 11".

3. Run the "SIH Devices Non Admin Step 0.0.bat" which will install all the needed software on both admin and user accounts.

4. Follow the command prompt prompts whenever necessary.
